>matus mentioned this one might be problematic so look into it

    -Using the positions of components Aâ€“C and of lensing galaxy G (which of course might not bethe only lensing galaxy) > is there a second galaxy?
    -Two additional minor possibilities exist: (1) that component D is a second lensing galaxy and contributes significantly to the lensing potential, which would change the
    lensing model such that the predicted position of component D0 is incorrect, and (2) that this lensing system has a very interesting lensing potential that produces only three
    lensed components.
    -The estimated colors and the spherical appearance of component G, therefore, indicate that it may be an elliptical galaxy at 0:2 < z < 0:5. 
    This would be the primary lensing galaxy of this lensing system. 
    -To settle  the issue of what causes the lack of the fourth quasar component, we need to obtain deeper and higher resolution images and more sensitive faint-object spectroscopy of
      component D.

   - While we cannot exclude the possibility that millilensing by dark matter substructure is also present, we conclude that microlensing is present and sufficient to
    explain existing data. Under this hypothesis, the A/D flux ratio should return to a value close to unity on a timescale of years rather than millennia.
    -Thus, we conclude that there is a range of microlensing models with reasonable parameters that can explain he flux ratio anomaly in SDSS J0924+0219 acceptably well.
    -We believe that microlensing offers the best and most natural explanation for SDSS J0924+0219, but concede that we cannot rigorously rule millilensing out.
    -If there is only microlensing, then over the next few years, image D ought to return to the brightness predicted by smooth lens models, in both the continuum and emission-line. 
      If there is anymillilensing, then differences between observed and smooth model flux ratios will persist for centuries.
 >Macleod 2015: 
    We analyze the optical, UV, and X-ray microlensing variability of the lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219
    >Optical for 10 yrs in R band
    >UV for 10 epochs
    >IR done
    -SDSS J0924+0219 exhibits pronounced microlensing variability in the UV compared to the optical, indicating a comparatively small extent for the UV continuum emitting
    region, as expected for an accretion disk.
    -The microlensing variability in SDSS J0924+0219 is even more pronounced in the X-rays compared to the optical and UV, indicating an even smaller extent for the X-ray continuum
    emitting region. >about background galaxy
    -These results confirm that the X-ray continuum emitting regions in quasars are compact, supporting models involving an X-ray emitting region concentrated near 
     the inner edge of the accretion disk, >about background galaxy
