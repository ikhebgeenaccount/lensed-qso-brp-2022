Myers paper = discovery paper. table 1. Split up in 3 components A,B,C. In Xband (8.4351 and 8.4851 GHz with an average frequency of 8.46
GHz) an Uband (14.94 GHz) of NRAO Very Large Array. A and B are probably the 2 images. uncertainties in caption

Rusin paper (2002)
table 1: B1152+199 component flux densities (in mJy) at 1.4, 5, 8.4 and 15 GHz. Split in components again, A end B. e 1999 July 15 VLA obs. 
table 2: Data from the VLBA 5-GHz observation of 2001 February 27 and 2001 March 18. \split into jets and core.
