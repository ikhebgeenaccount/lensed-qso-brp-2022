Stacey+2018: no upper limits

Oguri 2008:
-uh88 skipped since lensprofile unavailable
-magellan panic> used wavelengths found in 	http://instrumentation.obs.carnegiescience.edu/wirc/wircpaper.pdf and 2mass zeropoints https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/376474/pdf , these are useful for model plotting but maybe not for agnfitter
-ARC telescope was left out since we already have Hband from PANIC and from 2mass. Mochten we weinig andere data vinden kan dit altijd nog toegepast worden

Blackburne 2011
Has MAGic data, but nothing absolute, so we can't use it.
source:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/729/1/34/pdf
NOT USED

Stacey 2015 (master thesis)
No access...

Rusu 2016:
has subaru data, use conversions from Ned but components from this paper :)
source:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.458....2R/abstract

Shajib, 2019:
No castles data is available, but this paper does give some componental hst data, so nice
converted as other hst data
source:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.5649S/abstract

NED:
done:
wise
galex 1
subaru
2mass

not yet done:
galex 1 upper limit

not done:
sdss
hst
gaia since we already have optical

OTHER TO DO:
upper limit galex
is it a disklike lensing galaxy> rusu
check why shajib so low
