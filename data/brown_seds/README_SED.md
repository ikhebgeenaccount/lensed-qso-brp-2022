# Spectral energy distributions

This directory will contain the SED data. Currently it is in the form of text files (no special header format)
with two columns: first column is wavelengths in **ANGSTROMS** and second column is the flux in **WAVELENGTH**
units.

When the parametrisation of SED method is designed this format may change radically.


### Current status

Each text file represents a different galaxy SED and are the Coleman, Wu, Weedman & Kinney & two synthetic
starburst spectra taken from the [BPZ](http://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/) photo-z code.
