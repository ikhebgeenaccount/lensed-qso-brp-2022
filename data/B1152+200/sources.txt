Stacey 2018
herschel/SPIRE telescope
appendix: 250,350 & 500 micrometers, fluxes given in mJy with errors
last 2 have only upper limit

Myers 1999 = discovery paper
NRAO Very Large Array
table 1: Split up in 3 components A,B,C. In Xband (8.46GHz) an Uband (14.94 GHz), 
A and B are the 2 images, given in mJy. C component is 'unrelated in a lensing sense', so left out.

Toft paper (2000)
U B V R I z' photometry with the nordical optical telescope, ALFOSC instrument.
z' was not used since no absolute fluxes/magnitudes were given
table 3: Again multiple components, written down in magnitudes. These were calculated online.
Uncertainty in magnitudes see notebook, simple propagation of errors, for magnitude and sum.
For 2 bands the magnitude of the galaxy was also given, this has been added.

Edwards paper (2001)
Australia Telescope Compact Array
table 1: 6.08 Ghz and 8.64 Ghz. Multiple dates, A and B components. fluxes given in mJy, with uncertainties
weighted mean was taken over dates, with weighted error, propagation of errors for combined fllux error

2 filters with sigma=0, see excel sheet for calculating sigmas.
maybe method a bit too difficult, but hardly a difference with simple method

panstarrs:
catalogue:https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS
from counts to magnitudes:https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Stack+images#PS1Stackimages-Photometriccalibration
The catalogue was used, searched for the coordinates given in the QSO database, with an angle of 5 arcseconds. Found 4 sources, most quite dim but one with magnitude around 17. 
Then using ds9 by making an aperture, and transforming the counts to magnitudes we found a rough estimate, which was also around 17. This must be the galaxy, so these values were used in the table. 
for magnitudes, column _meanPSFMag was used, since this galaxy is pretty round. Lars' galaxy was a little differet
for uncertainties, we used _meanPSFMagerr, as the uncertainty in the stacked image
central wavelengths: https://coolwiki.ipac.caltech.edu/index.php/Central_wavelengths_and_zero_points

transforming to fluxes, use AB system, see excel sheet, same prop of errors as in sdss
