Toft paper (2000)
U B V R I z' photometry with the nordical optical telescope, ALFOSC instrument.
z' was not used since no absolute fluxes/magnitudes were given
table 3: Again multiple components, written down in magnitudes. 
Used AB magnitudes for calculation of fluxes, with code

SDSS:

magnitude uncertainties: http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/explore/Summary.aspx?id=1237668297664692248 
2 filters with sigma=0, used code for calculating fluxes.
maybe method a bit too difficult, but hardly a difference with simple method

panstarrs:
catalogue:https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS
from counts to magnitudes:https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Stack+images#PS1Stackimages-Photometriccalibration
The catalogue was used, searched for the coordinates given in the QSO database, with an angle of 5 arcseconds. Found 4 sources, most quite dim but one with magnitude around 17. 
Then using ds9 by making an aperture, and transforming the counts to magnitudes we found a rough estimate, which was also around 17. This must be the galaxy, so these values were used in the table. 
for magnitudes, column _meanPSFMag was used, since this galaxy is pretty round. Lars' galaxy was a little different.
to fluxes with code
for uncertainties, we used _meanPSFMagerr, as the uncertainty in the stacked image
central wavelengths: https://coolwiki.ipac.caltech.edu/index.php/Central_wavelengths_and_zero_points
WHEN PLOTTING THIS DATA there is some weird dip, but this is explained in the magnitudes themselves, not our problem


hst/castles:
source:https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/castles/Individual/B1152.html
same method as 1633+3134, using code
there is a G' components, we assumed it was wat Matus explained>> hst has good resolution so it does not detect some pixels as having a source if it is too close to the rms noise,  
So spplits it up into G' and G. There is no indication in any other paper that it is anything other than a simple elliptical, should be fine. We have added the 2 components together as to form a single galaxy component. 
DONT RUN MAGS AGAIN, SINCE I CALCULATED SOME THINGS BY HAND > Castles has been deleted from here

NED:
ADDED:
WISE in the one that has 18 phot, chose profile-fit
2mass in the one with 18 phot, chose profile-fit
Galex: in the on with 4, used 7.5 arcsec, only allsky available
Chandra, since the 20 and the 28 source thing give wildly different values for ;ext end the other one, we have added these sources since we think it's because they are distinguishable on the ccd

NOT YET ADDED: 
VLA
(VLBI, NRAO, TEXAS)

NOT ADDED:
gaia, sdss,
