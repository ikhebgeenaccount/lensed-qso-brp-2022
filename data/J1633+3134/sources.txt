panstars:
Done with code
checking with panstarr counts to see if same galaxy was selected> approx 17.9 so should be allright

Yonehara 2008>Castles survey>HST data
one paper led to a rabbit hole of other papers, found hubble magnitudes seperately for gallaxy, A and B.
However, recalculating to flux was tricky since I do not know which magnitude system they used. I chose VEGAMAG, however we should check this.
