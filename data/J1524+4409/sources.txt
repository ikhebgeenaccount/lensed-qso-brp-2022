NOT USED since SDSS data from an earlier data release, use DR14 instead
Edit from later: This galaxy had NO componentwise data, but this paper had some UH88. UH88 is impossible to find, but here:
https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/88inch/2.2-meter-technical.htm
they mentioned that the OPTIC instrument which was used here is sometimes at the WIYN telescope. Herefore we concluded that these filters must also be the same, 
so we have added the UH88 with the WIYN filters, to get some componentwise data

uh88 since no zeropoints to be found to check, weird telescope, no filterprofiles available as well
