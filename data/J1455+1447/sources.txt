HOWEVER later we found the sama wavelength in the ned database for 3 different valuesm neither corresponding to the flux we calculated. Since we had no way of knowing which one would be correct >> ned does not reference well >> we chose to emit this datapoint altogether. we have a 2mass datapoint around the same wavelength
