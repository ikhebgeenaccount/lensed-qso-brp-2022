Stacey+2018: no upper limits

Oguri 2008:
-uh88 skipped since lensprofile unavailable
-magellan panic> used wavelengths found in 	http://instrumentation.obs.carnegiescience.edu/wirc/wircpaper.pdf and 2mass zeropoints https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/376474/pdf , these are useful for model plotting but maybe not for agnfitter
-ARC telescope was left out since we already have Hband from PANIC and from 2mass. Mochten we weinig andere data vinden kan dit altijd nog toegepast worden
