Stacey+2018: no upper limits

Oguri 2008:
-uh88 skipped since lensprofile unavailable
-magellan panic> used wavelengths found in 	http://instrumentation.obs.carnegiescience.edu/wirc/wircpaper.pdf and 2mass zeropoints https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/376474/pdf , these are useful for model plotting but maybe not for agnfitter
- Magellan PANIC used to split 2MASS, except for K' filter which is already split for Rusu 2016 Subaru
-ARC telescope was left out since we already have Hband from PANIC and from 2mass. Mochten we weinig andere data vinden kan dit altijd nog toegepast worden

Blackburne 2011
Has MAGic data, but nothing absolute, so we can't use it.
source:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/729/1/34/pdf
NOT USED

Stacey 2015 (master thesis)
No access...

Rusu 2016:
has subaru data, use conversions from Ned but components from this paper :)
 Also, the lens in SDSS J1330+1810 is originally fitted with Sersic index ´ ∼3.4, but ∼2.2 in the new data, closer to the morphology of a disc-like galaxy.

Shajib, 2019:
No castles data is available, but this paper does give some componental hst data, so nice
Used to split SDSS, F160W not used
source:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.5649S/abstract

NED:
done:
wise
galex with 7.5 arcsec
subaru
2mass


not done:
sdss
hst
gaia since we already have optical

OTHER TO DO
check why shajib so low
