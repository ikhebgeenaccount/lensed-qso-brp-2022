NED:
ADDED:
wise>used profule-fit, has 1 upper limit so no data
galex> used 7.5 arcsec since no other sources nearby, used medium sky survey
CHANDRA: gives 2 pages, one with ;ext and one with;var. We have assumed this is for the 2 components that can be distuinghuished in pictures, so we added them together and assumed they were the total flux combined. Used flux_aper. 

NOT ADDED:
SUBARU (page with phot=3) since it had no errorbars, we could still add this as upperlimit maybe?
sdss
MIPS,NRAO,some other nameless things
HST: first page has some more filters
