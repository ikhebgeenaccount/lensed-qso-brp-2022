# lensed-qso-brp-2022
Hi guys, 
we have spent our bachelors project (feb to june 2022) working on using AGNfitter on lensed quasars. In this time we have written quite a lot of code, so this can easily be re-used.

-layout of the github
  properties of sample


-How to compile an SED\
  -magnitude to flux
  -Ned to sed
  -magnitude ratios
  -plots of SED(components)
-Foreground model subtraction
  -special cases
  -plot of fit
-Automated AGNfitter
  -preparing AGNfitter for your sample
-plots

-some useful things for latex output, etc, brp style, ...
