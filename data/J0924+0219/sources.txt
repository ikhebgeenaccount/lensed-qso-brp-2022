THIS GALAXY HAS REFERENCES TO PANIC, IMACS AND MAGIC, but right now none are used/end up in the sed


WEIRD QUASAR
Stacey 2018:
yay no upper limits

4 components damn

Inada 2003:
sdss used more recent datarelease
keck was spectra, not continuum
Magellan: Some are upper limits in de u band
source: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/375906/pdf
It was never mentioned in the paper whether these are Ab or vega magnitudes, so I assumed AB magnitudes>> Might exclude this from the dataset, since same problem as with dataset
SDSS-split magnitudes: only use these to fit foreground galaxy. SDSS catalog has more recent and better total mags, but split values are useful for G.

Keeton 2006:
hst fluxes given in A^-1, so conversion sucks.
However, the 2 main bands we already have, and the others are 'spectroscopic continuum fluxes' so are they useful?

NOT YET ADDED

morgan 2006:
same hst as from castles, magnitudes match

NOT USED

Floyd 2009:
More magellan walter baade 6.5 telescope
filters: http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/index.php?mode=browse&gname=LCO&gname2=IMACS&asttype=


Floyd 2009:
This has data from magellan walter baade telescope, same as Inada, but 2 different instruments(IMACS  and  PANIC).
I have not used these (yet) since IMACS seems really similar to sdss, and the panic wavelengths are quite impossible to find.

Blackburne 2011;
source: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/729/1/34/pdf
no (useful) data found, relative fluxes, but nteresting paper

Pooley 2012:
not used since it does have chandra data, but this can be found in easier fluxes at the ned database
source:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/744/2/111/pdf
NOT USED

Macleod 2015:
has a new hubble filter f275W, but tim dependant data over 2 years. magnitude shifts about 1.5. Not used here but fun to keep an eye on
source: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/258/pdf
NOT USED

Ducourant 2018
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180507359D/abstract
NOT USED since the data is also in NED

Peng 2006
source: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/506266/pdf
NOT USED but gives seperately quasar and host magnitudes, might be useful to check

NED:
-WISE was always added, chose profile-fit
-galex: AB means AB magnitude. for FUV and NUV, chose the medium sky survey since deeper, chose kron fluxes.
-2mass: chose profile-fit
-Chandra was always added, left out 0.5-8 kev and 0.3-8 kev since inconsistent with itself. For the other filterbands use flux_aper;var
always left out: hst(no components), sdss(already have them), USNO(more optical), GAIA(more optical)
in the file with 11 measurements there are 2 vlt images. However looking at the paper, this was not the total flux but the lensing galaxy flux. Will add this by hand to sed.

Faura 2011
VLT data FROM THE LENSING GALAXY, conversion by ned and added to sed ny hand
