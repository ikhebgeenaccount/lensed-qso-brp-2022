\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Quasar discovery}

In the 1950's, some anomalous radio sources (3C 273 and 3C 48) were found in large radio surveys. No bright optical component was found, and the spectrum taken did not resemble anything we had ever known. These objects were referred to as 'quasi stellar radio sources'  or 'quasars', due to the loud radio emission and their point-like shape. \\
Eventually it was found that the unidentified spectral lines were actually ordinary spectral lines redshifted by an enormous amount. This would suggest they are very far away and thus extremely bright. 
It was also found that these earliest discovered quasars would change luminosities within timescales of years, thus adding an upper limit to the size of these objects, of about 1 lightyear. Hence we know that the quasars are very luminous and very compact. For a more thorough overview of he history of quasar research, see Shields 1999\cite{Shields1999}\\
In 1964 Salpeter \cite{Salpeter1964} suggested that the light might be coming from the accretion disk surrounding a black hole. Due to friction, the gas falling in the black hole heats up and emits a lot of radiation. This accretion disk can cause extreme luminosities, sometimes the quasar can emit more light than the galaxy hosting it.  \\
Eventually, it became widely accepted that quasars are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These AGNs are black holes in the centres of galaxies,  that do not shine because of starlight or gas emission, but because of mass accretion around a black hole. Later, radio quiet quasars ('quasi stellar objects' or 'QSO's') were discovered as well. It was found that these tend to outnumber the radio-loud quasars. However, since both radio-loud quasars and radio-quiet QSO's are probably both driven by the same mechanism of matter falling into a black hole, the term quasar is used interchangeably. (Sparke \& Gallagher 2007\cite{sparke_gallagher}\\


\subsection{Black hole gas accretion}
 An amazing discovery of the last decades was finding massive black holes in the centers of many massive galaxies near us. In the years following, we have discovered more about the evolution of these massive black holes over time. They grow  because of mass accretion from their host galaxy, which causes them to become AGN's (eg Salpeter(1964)\cite{Salpeter1964}, Lynden-Bell(1969)\cite{Lynden1969}). The enormous amounts of energy this mass accretion allows them to emit, causes them to be able to outshine their host galaxies. (Alexander et al. 2012, \cite{alexander_2012}) How this mass accretion works is not exactly clear. There is not one typical mass accretion rate, as merely in the local universe AGN mass accretion rates are found to be between $10^{-5} $  and  $ 1 M_\odot \rm{yr}^{-1}$. This sounds like very little, however an accretion of $ 1 M_\odot \rm{yr}^{-1}$ is enough for an AGN to outshine the entire host galaxy. This is because a very large fraction ($\epsilon=0.05-0.42$) of the rest mass is converted into energy depending on the spin of the black hole. (eg Kerr 1963\cite{Kerr1963}, Shapiro et al.  1983 \cite{Shapiro1983}).

 \newline
A relation between the growth of the host galaxy and the AGN might be expected, since both are driven by how much cold gas is present in the galaxy or the larger scale environment. However it is not clear how this gas would reach the AGN, since both component have vastly different sizes. If there is a relation, this seems to exclude the possibility of a causal relation. In order for cold gas in the galaxy to reach the AGN, enormous physical distances must be travelled, and furthermore the gas needs to lose much of its angular momentum (99.9 \%). Before the gas is in the gravitational influence of the black hole, it needs to travel from a stable orbit at about 10kpc to about 10 pc, an enormous difference(Alloin et al. 2010,\cite{Alloin2010}). One way gas can reach the AGN is by nuclear gas inflows(Fathi et al. 2006 \cite{Fathi2006}), however identifying these gas inflows is hard, since the gas kinematics of luminous AGNs are often dominated by gas-outflow signatures(Storchi-Bergmann et al. 2010\cite{Storchi2010}). The best constraints are thus limited to low luminosity AGNs with low gas-inflow rates, which is a considerable bias.

%rewrite this
%The current consensus view is therefore one where gas inflow from kpc scales down to the central 10–100 pc region occurs in all gas-rich galaxies. The gas is driven into the central region through a series of gravitational instabilities, which helps to over- come the angular momentum of the gas. The clearest triggers of AGN activity in the local Universe are on the smallest scales, which is perhaps not surprising given that the gas inflow time from the host galaxy down to the pc-scale of the BH accretion disc is likely to be J 108 yr, comparable to or longer than the duration of the AGN phase (e.g., Martini et al., 2003; Hopkins and Quataert, 2010).
\newline Another obstacle is the possibility that before this gas can reach the AGN, it collapses to form a star. When this star formation is widely occurring, there is not enough fuel left for accretion(eg Toomre et al. 1964\cite{Toomre1964}), and the quasar will not be able to shine as bright as it does. However, young stars being present might also cause AGN activity, since the winds caused by massive stars and supernovae might drive gas into the black hole(SOURCE). Multiple studies have shown the presence of young stars in the vicinity of the black holes(SOURCE). Spatially resolved spectroscopy has actually shown that peak AGN activity occurs approximately $50-200$ Myr after the onset of star formation, so this might show a causal relation between star formation and AGN activity(Davies et al. 2007 \cite{Davies2007}). \\
There are some  processes that might allow for gas to travel to such small physical distances from the AGN, like galaxy major mergers, star formation winds or AGN outflows. All of these have been proven to occur in individual galaxies, but there is no concensus about a general process.(eg Shlosman et al. 1990\cite{Shlosman1990}, Barnes et al. 1992 \cite{Barnes1992})\\ %(cite others from Alexander review?))

To conclude, the interplay between cold gas reservoirs, star formation and quasar activity is complex, and there is no clear consensus of how these processes work. 





 


\subsection{ AGN variability}


\subsection{Quasar and host evolution}
%Interaction between the host galaxy and the quasar occurs through interactions with the interstellar medium, which causes either the quenching or induction of star formation in the host galaxy \cite{stacey_2018}.

%However, this picture is challenged by observations of an ongoing star formation and the discovery of large gas reservoirs in z=1-3 unobscured quasar hosts.$
% AKA Why is this picture not right??
%SOURCES in the piece below, see stacey
A proposed model for the evolution of quasar hosts has been proposed (Stacey 2018 \cite{stacey_2018}, hereafter S18), in which dusty star forming galaxies (DSFG)  are starbursts formed by gas-rich major mergers. After the DSFG phase, they will turn into dust-obscured quasars, hosted by an intensely star forming galaxy. When the AGN depletes the system of gas and dust through feedback effects, the quasars become unobscured and UV luminous. The hosting galaxy ends up as a quiescent elliptical, since no cold gas is left for further star formation. In the transition phase in which the quasar is dust-obscured and the galaxy is highly star-forming, the s in the FIR . However observations from eg. Simpson et al. 2012 \cite{Simpson2012} find a low spatial density of galaxies in this transition phase. They therefore  suggest that the transition phase between DSFGs and unobscured quasars is quick (approximately 1Myr). However, there might be a bias towards brighter sources, thus at lower redshifts. In order to get a better understanding of this obscured quasar model, we need to observe higher redshift galaxies. Gravitational lensing provides a method to do this, as the lensing will cause a magnification that allows us observe fainter quasar-hosting galaxies. 


\subsection{Gravitational Lensing}
Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon in which light from a distant astronomical object is deflected when it passes a mass distribution. This deflection happens because the mass is bending the curvature of spacetime.  (Bergström \& Goobar, 2006 \cite{Bergstrom2006}, herafter B06) Technically, a gravitational lens is not a lens, since it has no focal point.(Schneider et al. 1992 \cite{Schneider1992}, herafter S92) However since is allows light to be magnified and it creates images, the term lensing is used everywhere.\\
The first published papers  about gravitational lensing are from Orest Khvolson 1924 \cite{Khvolson1924} and Frantisek Link 1936 \cite{Link1936}, however Einstein made predictions of this phenomenon in 1912(\cite{Sauer2007}. A few centuries earlier, in 1784 \cite{Cavendish1784}, Henry Cavendish wrote (but never published) about this phenomenon in classical mechanics as well, however general relativity predicts double the value  of the angle of deflection(S92). In 1919, proof of the general relativity theory followed from observations during a solar eclipse by Arthur Eddington and Frank Watson Dyson \cite{Dyson1920}  , which showed that the positions of stars changed due to gravitational lensing when the light passed close to the sun. \\
In 1937, Fritz Zwicky \cite{Zwicky1937} theorized that galaxy clusters could act as a gravitational lens as well. In 1979 this was proved when the twin quasar SBS 0957+561 turned out to be the 2 images of 1 quasar, lensed by a galaxy\cite{Choi2013}. \\
General relativity states that light follows the curvature of spacetime, and mass curves it. When a light ray passes a massive object, it is thus deflected. The angle of deflection is \begin{equation}\theta = \frac{4 G M}{rc^2},\end{equation} (B06) where $r$  is the distance of the light ray to the mass $M$, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\\
Generally, 3 types of gravitational lensing are distinguished(S92). Strong lensing is when light is completely distorted. Multiple images of the same distant object can appear, as well as Einstein rings (when the background object is distorted into a full ring around the foreground lens) or arcs (when the background object is distorted into a circle-segment). This lensing is usually caused by a galaxy acting as the lens. \\
Weak lensing is when the distant object is only slightly distorted, by a few percent. Most of the weak lensing is found by statistical analysis of large datasets. Background stars will be stretched or otherwise distorted. When reconstructing the original shape of the background, it is possible to determine the mass distribution in between the object and the observer. This can help in determining the dark matter distribution in the universe.\\
Microlensing is the type of lensing where no visible distortion occurs. However, the flux coming from an object might change on observable timescales. This microlensing can for example be caused by stars in the milkyway, and is usually a one-time event. \\
In our sample, we are looking at strongly lensed galaxies, however in the system J0924+0219 , one of the components might be microlensed as well. We will discuss this more thoroughly further in the paper. Due to the strong lensing, the galaxies have multiple image components. The fluxes from the separate components are added together, and a total magnification factor for each system is used to deal with this appropriately. \\
The magnification caused by the lensing is what allows us to look at objects with fainter apparent brightness, so it will allow us to look at a more typical population of quasar hosting galaxies. 



\subsection{Galaxy main sequence}
% 
In this work we adopt the Speagle Galaxy Main Sequence (MS)\cite{speagle_galms}, which describes a relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass ($M_*$) of a galaxy. This relation takes the form of $\log\mathrm{SFR} = \alpha\log M_* + \beta$. Galaxies that are star forming, generally fall within this main sequence, while quiescent galaxies will fall below it, due to their lower SFR. This relation is also dependent on the age of the universe and shows a decrease in SFR for older galaxies. [insert plot for multiple redshifts Speagle MS]

Speagle et al. base their MS on a large set of observations between $z ~ 0-6$, which they obtain from previously published literature. These published data often do not use standardized calibrations, making comparisons difficult. To combat this issue, Speagle et al. have converted the data to the same absolute calibrations. This results in a large sample of comparable data, from which they can obtain a uniquely complete SFR-$M_*$ relation. Another consequence of this methodology is that they can pinpoint biases and quantify how different selections of data change the MS.

The aforementioned reasons mean that the Speagle Galaxy Main Sequence is a good framework to place galaxies in and compare them to, as it allows us to not only determine the validity of our results[, but also make comparisons to other quasars] % Comparisons: TBD, could be interesting, could be impossible?

\subsection{Present our sample}
For this research, we have studied 10 gas rich quasar hosting galaxies at a redshift of approximately $z=1-1.5$, lensed by a foreground galaxy at $z=0.3-0.6$. We have collected archival photometric data of these systems to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED). After this a model was fitted to the foreground galaxy in order to seperate the foreground galaxy and the quasar-hosting background galaxy. When we had collected SED's of only the background galaxy including the quasar, we applied AGNfitter. AGNfitter models the contributions from the accretion disk (Big Blue Bump), the dust re-emmision of this radiation (Torus), the stellar population and the star formation in the galaxy. A complete description of this tool will be provided in the corresponding chapter. AGNfitter allowed us to determine the gas mass and star formation rate of the systems in our sample, so we can place them in relation to the galactic main sequence.  \\


In chapter 2 we will discuss the data collection from archival data, in chapter 3 the foreground model fitting will be discussed. In chapter 4, the AGNfitter method is described, and conclusions will be given in chapter 5. In chapter 6 these conclusions will be discussed. \\

\section{Data collection}
\subsection{General idea about how we selected the data}

We are seeking to compile a spectral energy distribution (SED) for each lensing system selected. For this we used archival data from previous publications, as well as surveys and databases. Since this data will be analyzed with AGNfitter, we use only continuum data. Spectral lines would convolute the results of AGNfitter, since it is meant for broadband filters only.\\

In well resolved images, we can distinguish between the different images of the background galaxy (referred to as A,B,C,...) and the lensing galaxy in the foreground (referred to as G). The number of lensed images was either 2 or 4. Sometimes, the fluxes or magnitudes were only given for the total system. In the resolved case, we added the fluxes together, but kept track of the component-wise data as well.  AGNfitter was not designed specifically to be used for lensed galaxies, therefore we first select the total flux of the system, and after foreground galaxy subtraction we eventually divide by the magnification to get the true fluxes that the quasar hosting galaxy would emit.  \\

Having separate photometry for the lensing galaxy is useful, since this will be used eventually to fit a model to the foreground galaxy, see next chapter. This is because for AGNfitter, only the photometry of the background galaxy and the quasar is used, so the model of the foreground galaxy was subtracted.\\

For all galaxies, we were able to compile a spectrum with data in the optical and IR, as well as microwave data. Then for most we were able to add some UV, and for some we found also radio and X-ray data. The standard branch of AGNfitter does not include radio and X-ray data, however a version including this also exists. We will use both in this paper. 



\subsection{General remarks}
Most of our data comes from surveys such as 2MASS, SDSS, GALEX, Chandra and WISE. In the optical, almost all the data comes from SDSS. PAN-STARRS is another survey in the optical, but was found to disagree with SDSS. This can be explained by the variability of AGNs and the time delay from lensing. [AGN variability, COSMOGRAILchose SDSS over panstarrs since more avereraged out, mention why this was not a problem for other wavelengths]\\

The data from 2MASS, GALEX, Chandra and WISE was obtained from the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED), which lists multiple fluxes per band, depending on how the observation data are reduced to fluxes. For 2MASS and WISE, the qualifier 'Profile fit' was chosen. For Chandra, 'flux\_aper' was chosen, since [...]. For some galaxies, Chandra data was listed under different coordinates in NED, since in some cases the quasar images and the lens were separately resolved. These were added together to find a total flux. Three different variations of 'flux\_aper' exist, those being 'flux\_aper', 'flux\_aper;ext' and 'flux\_aper;var'. The difference between these is not one that caused an issue, as 'ext' and 'var' are flags for an extended source and a variable source. The variability is a known issue and we deal with this as mentioned above, and since we are studying galaxies it is known that they might be extended sometimes. In the case of GALEX data, we chose the qualifier 'Flux in 7.5 arcsec diameter aperture', since none of our systems have another source within 7.5 arcsec. \\

CASTLES [source] and other Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations also provided data for us. However, these data points were systematically lower than SDSS in the optical. This is most likely caused by the fact that the HST has a much higher resolution and can separate the images of the quasar from the lens galaxy. This causes the light of these [parts] to be more spread out, which can result in extended emission not being properly detected and instead being attributed to noise. Without this extended emission, the flux calculated from these images will be lower than the flux obtained from SDSS, which does not resolve these separate images. Therefore, we decided to use HST data to split the total fluxes from SDSS, as HST data can tell us the flux ratios between the separate components. This process is described in section \ref{mag_ratio_split}. For HST data which did not have a similar filter nearby ($\leq 1000$ Angstrom from central wavelength to central wavelength), we chose to use the HST data as is, as some data is better than none for these wavelengths.\\

Not all data found in papers and databases was used in this work. for example, when no absolute fluxes were known but only flux ratios, these were often left out. It was decided that surveys such as GAIA would be left out as well. It would cause too much overlap with data from other surveys, such as SDSS in this case. Having multiple datapoints at very similar wavelengths causes AGNfitter to crash, since it is unable then to distinguish between different filters. Also, resolutions and observation times were considered for these decisions. \\

In some cases, data points were given as upper limits of flux or lower limit of magnitude, instead of an actual value. This is when the object is detected in some bands, but falls under the detection limit of the instrument in other bands. AGNfitter can deal with these upper limits, so they were included in the SEDs.\\


\subsection{from magnitudes to fluxes}
Sometimes a conversion from magnitudes to fluxes (in mJy) had to be made when using data from previous publications. This is dependent on the zeropoints of the telescope and the filter, and on whether AB magnitudes or Vega magnitudes were given. This was converted back to fluxes ($F_\lambda$) with the standard formula \begin{equation}
F_\lambda = F_0 \cdot 10^{-\frac{mag}{2.5}}.
\end{equation} In the table below [\ref{table:filter_conv}] one can find the used conversion factors for any telescope where a conversion was made. For data that was already given in flux units, the conversion did not have to be made, so these telescope filters are not mentioned in the table. For some magnitudes, we were  unable to find what conversion and zeropoint was applicable. In these cases, we used the magnitudes to split into components the flux of a filter for which we only know the total flux, which is described in section \ref{mag_ratio_split}.\\

\subsection{Mag ratio to split total flux}\label{mag_ratio_split}
In the case of the telescope UH88 and specifically the 8k mosaic CCD camera and QUIRC instruments we were unable to find what magnitude system the found magnitudes\cite{dc_08062006_inada2006} were using, or the zeropoints for any magnitude system for the relevant filters. However, since these measurements are resolved, it would have been very useful when fitting a template to the foreground galaxy. Since these filters are in the optical range and have measurements for each component, we use this data instead to split other filters' total flux value into separate component fluxes.

A similar case is data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), either from the CASTLES survey or from specific observations found in papers. Compared to SDSS data, which has some overlap with HST filters, the HST data had consistently lower flux density values than SDSS. This is most likely caused by the fact that HST has a higher resolution than SDSS. Where SDSS sees all emission in one beam, HST can distinguish between the different components of the lensing galaxy and the quasar images. This causes some extended emission to be lost, as this is not grouped with all other emission, but instead is spread out over multiple pixels. If one such pixel only captures extended emission, this might not reach the detection limit and thus will be attributed to noise, resulting in a lower measurement for HST than for SDSS. Therefore, HST data, for which a different filter is close enough to the HST filter, is used to split the total flux of that close filter into components as well.

A filter is close to another filter when the distance between central wavelengths is $\leq 1000 \unit{\angstrom}$. When no other filter from a different telescope is close enough (this happens often for HST filter F160W), and there are few to no other resolved images of the system, we use the HST data as is. Otherwise we would not be able to fit a foreground galaxy template to the SED. \\
If two or more filters meet the $\leq 1000 \unit{\angstrom}$ condition, the filter that has the smallest distance will be used to split the total flux. The other filters will use the next closest bandpass, provided there is no overlap between those. If there is, again the filter with the smallest distance will prevail, while the other will move on to its third best. This repeats until every resolved magnitude has a matching filter to split, or there are no more filters close enough.  

Then, the resolved magnitudes are used to split the total flux value of the filter that they have been matched up with. This can be done, since the flux ratio of two components is independent of the zeropoint of the magnitude system used, and we assume that the amount of extended emission also scales with the total flux of every component.

From the magnitude difference between two components one can obtain the flux ratio,
\begin{equation}
m_i - m_j = -2.5 \log \frac{f_i}{f_j} \Rightarrow \frac{f_i}{f_j} = 10^{-\frac{(m_i - m_j)}{2.5}}.
\end{equation} Component fluxes are indicated by $f$, while component magnitudes are indicated using $m$. The indices are used to differentiate between components. The total flux of all components summed together $F_T$ is
\begin{equation}
F_T = \sum_i f_i = \sum_i \frac{f_i}{f_j}f_j = f_j \sum_i \frac{f_i}{f_j}.
\end{equation} $\sum_i$ indicates a sum over all components a lensed quasar has, so up to A, B, C, D and foreground galaxy G. Now, the flux for component $j$ is
\begin{gather}
f_j = F_T / \sum_i \frac{f_i}{f_j} = F_T / (1 + \sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} \frac{f_i}{f_j}) \\
= F_T / (1 + \sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-\frac{1}{2.5}(m_i - m_j)}) = F_T / (1 + 10^{m_j/2.5}\sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-m_i/2.5}).
\end{gather}

The expression for $f_j$ contains the total flux $F_T$ and component magnitudes $m_i$, $m_j$. $m_i$ is the magnitude of each component, except for component $j$. All these $m_i$ can have different errors, so the resulting error of $f_j$ $\sigma_{f_j}$ is
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{f_j} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial F_T} \sigma_{F_T}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial m_j} \sigma_{m_j}\right)^2 + \sum_{\substack{i \\ i \neq j}}\left(\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial m_k} \sigma_{m_k}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}

These derivatives are
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial F_T} = 1 / (1 + 10^{m_j/2.5}\sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-m_i/2.5}),\\
\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial m_j} = -\frac{\ln 10}{2.5} 10^{m_j/2.5}\left(\sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-m_i/2.5}\right) F_T / (1 + 10^{m_j/2.5}\sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-m_i/2.5})^2,\\
\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial m_k} =  -\frac{\ln 10}{2.5} 10^{m_j/2.5} 10^{-m_k/2.5} F_T / (1 + 10^{m_j/2.5}\sum_{\substack{i\\ i\neq j}} 10^{-m_i/2.5})^2.
\end{gather}

Another instrument for which we could not find zeropoints or magnitude systems was the PANIC instrument at the 6.5m Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory [source]. However since this data was not resolved we could not use it to split any other measurements, so it was left out completely. 

\subsection{galaxies}
% TODO: add morphologies with their sources, mention filtered sources for AGNfitter, fill in the split bands,  check everything

For all galaxies, the total SED will be shown below [!], however any remarks about specific data, morphology of the foreground galaxy and any other peculiarities will be mentioned here. 

\paragraph{J0806+2006}
J0806+2006 was discovered in 2006 by Inada et al. (2006, \cite{dc_08062006_inada2006}). Data from the UH88 telescope in the VRIH bands found in this paper was excluded since no zeropoints were available, however this data was used to split the SDSS i,r,g bands. The H-band magnitudes from the VLT (Sluse et al 2008 \cite{dc_08062006_sluse2008}) were taken from NED instead since this provides fluxes instead of magnitudes. The WISE data included 1 upper limit, so this was handled accordingly. The Inada paper used the two standard models for the mass modelling: a singular isothermal sphere with an external shear (SIS+shear) model and a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model. Therefore we find that we should fit ellipticals to the foreground galaxy.\\

\paragraph{J0924+0219}
Inada et al. (2003 \cite{Inada2003}, discovery) gives resolved SDSS magnitudes, however it used an older data release. In order to average out the AGN variability we want the most recent SDSS data release (DR14), so the Inada data was used to split more recent SDSS measurements in the u,g,r, and i filters. The Inada data itself was not included in the SED. The 2mass H filter measurement from NED was split using the HST F160W measurement from CASTLES [source], after which the F160W measurement was taken out of the SED. Other CASTLES data was not close enough to another wavelength to split these measurements, so they were left out completely.  In Faure et al. (2011, \cite{Faure2011}) a magnitude was given for the foreground galaxy, and no data for the background quasar host.  However, this data suggested that the foreground galaxy was brighter than the total SDSS and other optical data, for the whole system. Therefore it was chosen to omit this datapoint.\\
In the paper by Inada at al. is was mentioned that the D component displays anomalous reddening. Keeton et al. (2006, \cite{Keeton2006}) has shown that this can be explained by microlensing, an event that should have passed in timescales of years. This was neglected during the rest of this research, since it is beyond the scope of our project.

\paragraph{B1152+200}
B1152+200 was discovered in 1999 by Myers et al. \cite{Myers1999}. HST magnitudes were used to split SDSS and 2MASS data. Specifically, HST F555W was used to split SDSS r, HST F814W used for SDSS i, HST F160W used for 2MASS H. Two different measurements in all bands for the Chandra data were available on NED, with slightly different coordinates. One had the ;ext flag, one had none.  As described above, these are partially resolved measurements, so adding them together provides a total flux.\\
In Asadi et al. (2020, \cite{Asadi2020}) the lensing galaxy was modelled as a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) with external shear. This paper addresses some previous publications, that claimed there might be millilensing, since one of the radio jets seemed slightly curved on milliarcsecond scales. However new data analysis showed that this was merely an artefact due to the shape of the synthesized beam. Therefore we have fitted only on ellipsoidal lensing galaxy templates for this system.

\paragraph{J1330+1810} 
J1330+1810 was discovered by Oguri et al. in 2008 \cite{Oguri2008}. Measurements from this paper were used to split the 2MASS J and H filters, since for the Oguri measurements the Magellan PANIC filter profiles were not available. This paper models the foreground galaxy as both a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE), and a SIE plus external shear. Therefore when fitting to the foreground galaxy we selected only ellipticals. \\

J1455+1447 was discovered by Kayo et al (2010,\cite{dc_14551447_kayo2010)}, however the SDSS magnitudes in this paper were not used since there is a more recent SDSS datarelease (DR14, \cite{sdss_dr14}) available now. This paper presents a Sérsic index of 3.5, so we fitted ellipticals to the foreground galaxy. The only data available to fit a foreground model to is from Rusu et al.

The UH88 OPTIC measurements were used, since for this the filter profiles were available.

B1600+434 was discovered in 1997 (\cite{dc_1600434_jaunsen1997}) by Jaunsen et al. and these measurements were used to ... (where are the measurements? not used since a lot of optical data already known) Two different measurements in all bands for the Chandra data was available on NED, with slightly different coordinates.

HST data was available in Muñoz. et al (2011, \cite{dc_1600434_munoz2011}), and F814W data was used to split SDSS i, however the other filters were not used as there was no foreground galaxy data for these. Therefore we decided to fit the foreground galaxy templates to this Muñoz datapoint and the split SDSS datapoint. After this, the Munoz datapoint was excluded before running AGNfitter.\\
This galaxy is lensed by an edge-on spiral galaxy (Jaunsen et al. 1997, Koopmans et al. 1998 \cite{Koopmans1998}). This is the only spiral lensing galaxy in our sample, and some remarks about it can be found further in the paper.

\paragraph{B1608+656}
Discovered by Myers et al. (1995, \cite{dc_1608656_myers1995}), this galaxy is the only of our sample with no available SDSS data. In order to still have optical data, we decided to use PanSTARRS for this galaxy. However, a decision had to be made between using the aperture or the psf magnitudes. Since no other sources appear nearby, we decided to use the aperture. This way no extended emission will be missed. Two Chandra measurements were added together , with the same reasoning as above. HST data from Sluse et al. (2012,\cite{dc_1608656_sluse2012} ) was used to split a 2MASS H datapoint. \\
This system has an interesting lensing galaxy, since it is most likely two elliptical galaxies merging (Koopmans \& Fassnacht, 1999 \cite{Koopmans1999}). We have not treated these lensing galaxies different from others in our sample; since we take the average over multiple templates for each system this should take into account any difference in photometry caused by having 2 lensing galaxies.

(2001, \cite{Morgan2001}) used a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model to describe the gravitational potential of the hypothesized lensing galaxy, however at this point no resolved imaging was available. However we have not been able to find anything suggesting otherwise, so we will assume the foreground galaxy is an elliptical.\\

\section{Foreground galaxy subtraction}
Most of the data collected is single values for a total flux for a number of filters. To be able to find properties of the quasar being lensed, we need to separate the light from the quasar and the lensing galaxy. This is done by fitting model spectra to the few foreground fluxes we have, after which the best fitting model spectrum is subtracted from the total fluxes. This results in a new SED, which only contains the radiation coming from the quasar.

\subsection{SED model fitting}
The models used to fit the foreground galaxy are those found in the atlas provided by Brown et al.\cite{brown_seds}(hereafter Brown atlas). This atlas contains 129 spectra of galaxies found in our local universe. The spectra range from the ultraviolet to the mid infrared, which is where elliptical galaxies have a significant contribution (the shortcomings for spiral lensing galaxies are discussed in \ref{spiral_vs_ellipt}). Therefore, these models allow us to subtract close to the complete contribution of the foreground galaxy from the total flux. One caveat is that these model spectra are obtained from the local universe, while the lensing galaxies are at a redshift of $z \approx 0.3 - 0.6$. This could result in a difference in spectrum, as a higher redshift means a younger universe. However, there are no catalogues for spectra at those redshifts and the Brown atlas is the most complete atlas at this time, so currently we can not account for differences in spectra caused by this age difference.

The Brown atlas lists for each galaxy the morphology as well, which can be used to constrain the number of models that need to be fit to our lensing galaxies data. Nine out of ten foreground galaxies are ellipticals, with the last foreground galaxy being a spiral. The Brown atlas contains XX ellipticals, and XX spirals. For each foreground galaxy, all models of the corresponding morphology from the Brown atlas are fitted to the data using \texttt{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit}\cite{scipy}. Before this fitting is done, the model spectrum is first shifted according to the redshift of the lensing galaxy. This is important, since the model spectra are given in the rest frame of the galaxy, while our observations of the foreground galaxy are in our observer frame. The fitting is then done on the following equation
\begin{equation}
F(\lambda) = a \cdot F_m(\lambda),
\end{equation} where $a$ is a normalization factor, $F_m$ is the flux as given by the model $m$ from the Brown atlas at wavelength $\lambda$ and $F$ the resulting flux. The parameter that is fitted is $a$.
After fitting the reduced $\chi^2$ is calculated. The $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{chisqeq}
\chi^2_\textrm{red} = \frac{1}{\textrm{d.o.f.}}\sum_i \left(\frac{F_i(\lambda) - F(\lambda)}{\sigma_i^2}\right)^2,
\end{equation} with $F_i(\lambda)$ the measured flux of the foreground galaxy at wavelength $\lambda$, $F(\lambda)$ the flux given by the model, $\sigma_i$ the error on the measurement of the flux. The degrees of freedom $\textrm{d.o.f.}$ are given by 
\begin{equation}
\textrm{d.o.f.} = N - P = N - 1,
\end{equation} where $N$ is the number of datapoints and $P$ is the number of parameters of our model, in our case $P = 1$ since we fit only one parameter $a$.

The model with the lowest $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$ is the model that fits best to the data. However, most of the time several models will describe the data almost equally well. In these cases, we opt to use the weighted average of these similarly well fitting models, instead of just the best one. The weights are given by $1/\chi^2_\textrm{red}$, such that the best fitting model with the lowest $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$ value has the highest weight. The number of models that are combined depends on the shape of the curve of the $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$ values. Usually, there are a few models that fit quite well and to a similar extent, followed by a sharp jump into higher values of $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$. In these cases, the first few well-fitting models are used in the weighted average, ignoring every model after the sharp increase in $\chi^2_\textrm{red}$. In a few cases, no such clear separation was found. Here, we decided to use the first five models, as these had a decent spread in UV and MIR fluxes. Also, since a weighted average is used, adding many more models to this average did not significantly alter it. Finally, there were two special cases: the foreground galaxy that is a spiral, instead of an elliptical, which is discussed in section \ref{spiral_vs_ellipt} and two foreground galaxies that had only one flux datapoint, discussed in section \ref{fg_one_data}.

While \texttt{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit} returns an error on the fitted parameter $a$. However, since for every galaxy except one, a weighted average of multiple models is taken, the error instead becomes the standard deviation of the fluxes of the models, compared to which the error on $a$ is negligible. This means that each wavelength has a different error, which is a better description of the error ranges, as most of our foreground data comes from the optical. In this wavelength range, the error will be quite small as this is where the fitting happens. However, model spectra might differ significantly in the IR and UV, resulting in a higher error for these wavelengths.

Upper limits in foreground galaxy fluxes are ignored while fitting the model spectra. However, a visual check is done to ensure that the resulting model does not exceed the upper limit.

\subsection{Average modelling and subtracting}
- For a datapoint that is not split: subtract average flux in that filter's wavelength range as taken from the best fitting model\\
(- Multiply model first with filter profile of filter of data point that we are subtracting foreground galaxy from)\\
- Error propagation
- Sum components to find spectrum of quasar

\subsection{galaxies with only 1 foreground data point}\label{fg_one_data}
Two galaxies, J1650+4251 and J1455+1447 had only 1 datapoint to fit a foreground model to, even after all UH88 and HST splitting was done. For these systems, we were not able to determine which fit was best. For all of the 7 elliptical galaxies in our sample with multiple datapoints, we counted how often a model was in the top 5 of best fitting models. The 5 most occuring models were then averaged and fit to the single datapoint of J1650+4251 and J1455+1447. We believe this to be a reliable method since of the 7 ellipticals with multiple foreground datapoints, it was clear that some models were found much more often than others. The 5 models chosen for these galaxies were NGC\_3265, NGC\_0855, NGC\_4621, NGC\_4660, NGC\_4458.

\subsection{spiral vs ellipticals FIR emission}\label{spiral_vs_ellipt}
In S18, a larger sample of FIR lensed quasar hosts was studied. The authors had no method of excluding any flux from the foreground galaxy since, since no resolved data was available. Therefore they assume that none of the lensing galaxies has significant FIR emission.\\
The brown templates fitted to the lensing galaxies of our sample do not include FIR wavelengths, so we were tempted to make the same assumption. However, there is one spiral lensing galaxy in our sample, the lensing galaxy in the B1600+434 system. The best fitting foreground templates all seemed to increase at the FIR before being cut off, so we wanted to test whether there was indeed negligible FIR emission for spiral lensing galaxies. Of the 5 best fitting model templates to the foreground of B1600+434, 4 of them had available Herschel FIR data in the NED database. This data was made with the SPIRE instrument, at observer wavelengths of $250 \mu$, $350 \mu$ and $500 \mu$.  This data showed a non-negligible contribution of the lensing galaxy in the FIR, see figure \ref{Herschel_spiral} . The assumption made in S18 is therefore not valid for quasar hosts lensed by spiral galaxies, and we extended the average subtracted model to interpolate these Herschel datapoints for B1600+434. \\
We assumed that for ellipticals here was indeed no significant FIR emission since the SED for an elliptical cut off before that.  [source].
In order to double-check this we have also checked for some elliptical templates whether there was any significant FIR emission. For all the Herschel data of Brown galaxies we found that the emmision went steeply down, exactly as expected in S18 as well, so for all other galaxies in our sample we only used Brown templates.

\chapter{AGNfitter}
\section{AGNfitter}
\subsection{filter profiles}
In order to properly mimic the observed fluxes, AGNfitter integrates the emission templates $F_\lambda$ against the telescope response curves $S(\lambda)$ via \begin{equation} 
F_s = \frac{\int \lambda f_{\lambda} S(\lambda) d \lambda}{\int f_{\lambda} S(\lambda) d \lambda}.\end{equation} Here, $F_s$ is the resulting filtered flux. Some of these filter profiles $S(\lambda)$ were already present in AGNfitter, some had to be added by hand. For non-radio telescopes, the filter profiles could be found on the SVO filter profile service [source] as (wavelength, transmission) tables.\\
However, for radio telescopes no exact filters are known. Therefore we created tophat filter profiles ourselves. These are filter profiles with transmission = 1 within half a bandwidth of the central frequency, and 0 outside this range. The bandwidths corresponding to certain frequency ranges will be shown in table \ref{tab:radiotophat}. They were converted to wavelengths before being used in AGNfitter. For the Chandra telescope, tophats were constructed as well, according to the given passband in the NED database.\\
Another instrument that did not have a direct filter profile available was the OPTIC instrument at UH88 telescope, however since this instrument is also at the WIYN telescope 6 months a year, the filters for this telescope were used instead under the assumption that these are the same instruments.

\subsection{running it}
-the settings chosen\\
- initial position: uniform vs what AGNfitter does default\\
\subsection{magnification}
-megnificarion has a very large uncertainty\\
-tried running agnfitter first for still magnified, then for demagnified.\\
-errors in demag became so large that AGnfitter did not converge to anything\\
-we checked: setting erros to 0 but running demag, compare it to non-demagnified\\
-we found that, if the fits looked decent by eye, that the outputs varied as expected (so sfr by a factr of magnification, star mass, column density etc)\\
-not exact values but the variance falls properly inbetween the errorbars, just caused by different fits\\
-also backed by theory\\
-therefore we decided to run -sub first, then deal with the magnification like:\\
-we find ...\\
-we also ran multiple times to check which fit is the best and picked the best values from there
