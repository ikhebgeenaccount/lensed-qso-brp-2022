Yonehara 2008>Castles survey>HST data
one paper led to a rabbit hole of other papers, found hubble magnitudes seperately for galaxy, A and B.
However, recalculating to flux was tricky since I do not know which magnitude system they used. We chose Ab mag for all hst data. and more searching found also same zeropoint
